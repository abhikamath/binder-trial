# Getting `SCPToolbox.jl` to work via Binder:

## Changes to the repository:

- create `requirements.txt` for `matplotlib` support
- create `apt.txt` for LaTeX support
- include the following to `Project.toml` to make sure that the version of Julia instantiated is correct and consistent:

        [compat]
        julia "=1.7.1"

- (_Note_: some of the `Freeflyer` and `Rendezvous3D` tests fail (via `runtests.jl`)—all the other examples run successfully)

## Binder setup:

- visit https://mybinder.org/ (standard server; 2 GiB RAM) __OR__ https://notebooks.gesis.org/binder/ (reliable cluster; 8 GiB RAM)
  - (_Note_: the standard server configuration seems to be incapable of running `runtests.jl` without maxing out RAM usage—the process gets killed as a result)
- type `https://github.com/abhikamath/binder-trial` under "GitHub repository name or URL"
- type `dev/new-main` under "Git ref (branch, tag, or commit)"
- either click the `launch` button or paste the autogenerated URL in a browser tab
- testing the instantiation:
    - open a terminal window in the Jupyter environment
    - `~$ cd test`
    - `~/test$ julia`
      - modify `runtests.jl` as required (to include only the examples you would like to test)
    - `include("runtests.jl")`
    - grab some popcorn, sit back, and enjoy the show (only until you hit `Freeflyer` and `Rendezvous3D`, of course)

## Next steps:

- fix `Freeflyer` and `Rendezvous3D`
- make tutorial-optimized Jupyter notebooks for Dubin's car and planar rigid-body rocket-landing examples
- create a new branch for the AAS workshop
- host the tutorial notebooks on that branch
- include `launch binder` badge in `README.md`

## Future extensions:

- possibly merge the workshop branch with `master`
- make Dubin's car model trace "SCP racetrack" trajectory (as in the new logo)
- include 3D visualizations for the tutorial examples using `MeshCat.jl` or something similar
