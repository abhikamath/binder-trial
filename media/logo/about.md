The SCP Toolbox logo is composed of the following elements:

- SCP: this is the core algorithmic framework of the toolbox, which stands for
  "**S**equential **C**onvex **P**rogramming";
- _(t)_: most vehicle trajectories evolve in time (even though they can also
  evolve in any other monotonic variable, such as atmospheric density). The
  _(t)_ emphasizes the time-dependence of the optimization framework. It is
  also a happy coincidence that "time" and "toolbox" both start with a _t_!
