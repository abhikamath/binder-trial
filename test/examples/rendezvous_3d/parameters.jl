`ApolloCSM` stores the geometry and mechanical properties of the Apollo Command
and Service Module. The values are obtained from [1].

The notation `H_AB` represents a homogeneous transformation from frame `B` to
frame `A`, meaning that `y=H_AB*x` converts the vector `x` in frame `B` to the
corresponding (same) vector `y` in frame `A`.

There are :
- The dynamical frame (D) is the body frame in which the dynamics are
  expressed. It is located at the center of mass. Ultimately, this is the frame
  which we use to impse dynamics in the optimal control problem.
- The structural frame (S) is the frame in which much of Apollo CSM geometry is
  defined. It is located 1000 inches below the command module heat shield main
  structure ablation interface.
- The RCS frame (R) is rotated with respected to the S frame by -(7+15/60)
  degrees about the `x` axis. It is the frame in which the RCS thruster "quads"
  are aligned with respect to the ``\\pm z`` and ``\\pm y`` axes. Otherwise,
  the R and S frames are coincident.
- The quad frame (Q) is a frame located at the center of an RCS quad. There are
  four quads, thus there are four such frames. The frame is positioned such
  that its y axis is normal to the CSM fuselage and its x axis points forward
  (i.e. in the direction of the CSM nose, same as the S frame). The center is
  raises slightly above the CSM fuselage outer mold line, such that the RCS
  thrusters are located in the plane of the Q frame's x and y axes.
  - We refere to the four quads as `:A`, `:B`, `:C`, and `:D`, following NASA
    documentation.
- The thruster frame (T) is a frame centered at the point of application of the
  force produced by an RCS thruster. This is, roughly speaking, in the center
  of the combustion chamber part of the nozzle. The x axis of the T frame
  points out along the nozzle center, and the z axis lies in the (x, y) plane
  of the Q frame. Each thruster is canted 10 degrees away from the CSM
  fuselage. There are four thrusters per quad, hence there is a total of 16 T
  frames.
  - We refer to the thrusters as follows: `:pf` (pitch forward) points along Q
    frame +x, `:pa` (pitch aft) points along Q frame -x, `:rf` (roll forward)
    points along Q frame +z, and `:ra` (roll aft) points along Q frame -z. The
    primary torque effect of firing each thruster is:

                `:A`          `:B`          `:C`          `:D`       (Quad)
            +------------------------------------------------------+
      `:pf` | pitch up      yaw right     pitch down    yaw left   |
      `:pa` | pitch down    yaw left      pitch up      yaw right  |
      `:rf` | roll left     roll left     roll left     roll left  |
      `:ra` | roll right    roll right    roll right    roll right |
            +------------------------------------------------------+
  (Thruster)

- The docking port frame (P) is centered at the docking port in the nose of the
  spacecraft. This is the frame that is to be aligned with the lunar module
  docking port at the docking terminal condition.
